# Hi, I'm Peter

This serves as a brief introduction to a set of proposed values and goals. However

* This reflects broad generalizations and does not replace getting to know each other through 1:1s, day-to-day chats, etc.
* I am interested in continually iterating these beliefs and influences. Constructive feedback is always welcome.
* I am always learning and growing, if you observe that I am not living out one of these ideas please let me know. 

## As a Manager

A Manager/leader in an organization should seek to emulate the following:

1. Seeks to serve those who they manage and place the needs of the team before their own.
2. Practices '[Extreme Ownership](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Ownership-U-S-Navy-SEALs-ebook/dp/B00VE4Y0Z2)'. A leader is always responsible and must own any mistake or shortcoming of the team. i.e. "There are no bad teams; just bad leaders"
3. Creates a ['Psychologically safe'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6YbAvEtS8k) environment for the team members to succeed. Safe environments are the basis high performance per Google's [ReWork study](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/), [Maslow's heirarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs), and other similar studies.

## Growth

A manager/leader should encourage the following:

1. [Growth mindset](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/) Challenge themselves and others with assignments that stretch their capabilities
2. [Mastery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:_The_Surprising_Truth_About_What_Motivates_Us) Aim for a cadence of academic output with the goal of producing small tangible items of value over time. For example, one of more blog posts, open source & conference contributions, Stack Overflow questions, and other such efforts with a cadence, such as quarterly.  
## Focus

A key to being able to grow is being able to focus. Studies and some personal experience suggests that engineers need at least [4 hour blocks](https://chase-seibert.github.io/blog/2017/04/14/engineering-meeting-strategies.html) of uninterrupted time to achieve flow. Other literature, such as [Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1527856567&sr=8-1&keywords=deep+work+cal) highlight the benefits that many successful knowledge workers have achieved though utilizing periods of intense focus. 

* Protect engineers time, seeking to give as long uninterrupted stretches possible. 
* Perform daily standups over slack/chat when possible
* Timebox meetings
* Batch meetings do that they can occur together
* Allow engineers at least 24 hours to respond to any email or instant message
* Encourage those nearby to take calls in office rooms rather than the desk in the open office space

## 1on1s

Having [good 1on1's](https://a16z.com/2012/08/30/one-on-one/) relies on the belief that it is the employee's meeting, as they should do 90% of the talking. It is a free form meeting for any issues, concerns, ideas and frustrations not easily expressed in more formal channels. Ultimately, the [goal](https://a16z.com/2012/08/18/a-good-place-to-work/) of the 1on1 is the create a great company. 

## Feedback

Feedback is a gift. It is difficult to give, especially with quality. It is an ['unatural act'](https://www.radicalcandor.com/about-radical-candor/) Feedback should be received and given:

* With humility, we all have different perspectives and will often give different feedback in response to the same situation.
* With positive intent on someone's behalf
* With understanding, as even the best of us can have difficulty not taking occasional feedback personally

## Training

Andy Grove [High Output Management](https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove-ebook/dp/B015VACHOK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1526430507&sr=8-1&keywords=high+output+management) states that there are only two ways for a manager to improve the output of an employee, motivation and training. Training is a high return activity that should be led by the managers of an organization. a16z [shares](https://a16z.com/2010/05/14/why-startups-should-train-their-people/) how this is a great method to set expectations within an organization.

## Teams and meetings

Communication can be a big challenge as a team grows in size. The links between team members can be [modeled](http://blog.idonethis.com/two-pizza-team/) as (n*(n-1))/2 or roughly n^2. A team of 5 people has 10 links between the members whereas a team of 14 has 91. [Experiments](http://www.opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~kmilkman/2012_OBHDPb.pdf) have shown larger teams can be less efficient. Finally, the US Military has conducted extensive research on the topic and has found the [ideal team size](https://www.amazon.com/Team-Teams-Rules-Engagement-Complex/dp/1591847486) to be five members. Two recommendations can be drawn from this:

1. [Amazon](https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611), [Spotify](http://www.full-stackagile.com/2016/02/14/team-organisation-squads-chapters-tribes-and-guilds/) and others have demonstrated the power of small teams (<10 people) connected by api's.
2. Meetings should be as small as possible and invite those deemed absolutely necessary. Jeff Bezos ([allegedly](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/16/how-jeff-bezos-two-pizza-rule-can-lead-to-more-productive-meetings.html)) will not even show up if the meeting has more than 10 people. For the rest of us, an [8-18-1800](https://hbr.org/2015/03/how-to-know-if-there-are-too-many-people-in-your-meeting) rule can be a good guideline.
