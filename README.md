# Leading and Managing Engineers

This is a starting set of knowledge for leading engineers in an organization. This can never encompase everything but can spire to be a useful place to start. 

* Constructive feedback and contributions are always welcome.

## As a Leader or Manager

A leader in an organization should seek to emulate the following:

1. Seeks to serve those who they manage and place the needs of the team before their own.
2. Practices '[Extreme Ownership](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Ownership-U-S-Navy-SEALs-ebook/dp/B00VE4Y0Z2)'. A leader is always responsible and must own any mistake or shortcoming of the team. i.e. "There are no bad teams; just bad leaders"
3. Creates a ['Psychologically safe'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6YbAvEtS8k) environment for the team members to succeed. Safe environments are the basis high performance per Google's [ReWork study](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/), [Maslow's heirarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs), and other similar studies.

## Growth

A leader should encourage the following:

1. [Growth mindset](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/) Challenge themselves and others with assignments that stretch their capabilities
2. [Mastery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:_The_Surprising_Truth_About_What_Motivates_Us) Aim for a cadence of academic output with the goal of producing small tangible items of value over time. For example, one of more blog posts, open source & conference contributions, Stack Overflow questions, and other such efforts with a cadence, such as quarterly.  

## Focus

A key to being able to grow is being able to focus. Studies and some personal experience suggests that engineers need at least [4 hour blocks](https://chase-seibert.github.io/blog/2017/04/14/engineering-meeting-strategies.html) of uninterrupted time to achieve flow. Other literature, such as [Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1527856567&sr=8-1&keywords=deep+work+cal) highlight the benefits that many successful knowledge workers have achieved though utilizing periods of intense focus. 

* Protect engineers time, seeking to give as long uninterrupted stretches possible 
* Perform daily standups over slack/chat when possible
* Timebox meetings
* Batch meetings so that they can occur together
* Allow engineers at least 24 hours to respond to any email or instant message
* Encourage those nearby to take calls in office rooms rather than the desk in the open office space

## 1on1s

Having [good 1on1's](https://a16z.com/2012/08/30/one-on-one/) relies on the belief that it is the employee's meeting, as they should do 90% of the talking. It is a free form meeting for any issues, concerns, ideas and frustrations not easily expressed in more formal channels. Ultimately, the [goal](https://a16z.com/2012/08/18/a-good-place-to-work/) of the 1on1 is the create a great company. 

## Feedback

Feedback is a gift. It is difficult to give, especially with quality. It is an ['unatural act'](https://www.radicalcandor.com/about-radical-candor/) Feedback should be received and given:

* With humility, we all have different perspectives and will often give different feedback in response to the same situation.
* With positive intent on someone's behalf
* With understanding, as even the best of us can have difficulty not taking occasional feedback personally

Sometimes ask the person if they wish to have the feedback to illustrate its for their growth. 

## Training

Andy Grove [High Output Management](https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove-ebook/dp/B015VACHOK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1526430507&sr=8-1&keywords=high+output+management) states that there are only two ways for a manager to improve the output of an employee, motivation and training. Training is a high return activity that should be led by the managers of an organization. a16z [shares](https://a16z.com/2010/05/14/why-startups-should-train-their-people/) how this is a great method to set expectations within an organization.

## Interviewing

It is important to be humble in regards to interviewing. Good candidates may fail the interview and bad candidates may game your system. Nevertheless, it is important to be disciplined and always improving the interview practice based on feedback. Inspiring by [Steve Yegge's](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/five-essential-phone-screen-questions) post, I have found asking questions that cover multiple areas of computer science allows stronger computer science candidates to succeed and these candidates are generally more flexible and capable than asking trivia about a single technology. I try to cover:

- Whiteboard coding questions in the style of [Leet code](https://leetcode.com/) 

- General computer science O(n) of algorithms and data structures

- Linux questions (ls, grep, etc). Linux and bash are important and are growing faster than ever based on the [python developer report](https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2018/) and other sources. 

- System design [question](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) (How would you design an online web app that does x..). These questions tend to favor those with practical experience or a coding hobby. 

## Teams and meetings

Communication can be a big challenge as a team grows in size. The links between team members can be [modeled](http://blog.idonethis.com/two-pizza-team/) as (n*(n-1))/2 or roughly n^2. A team of 5 people has 10 links between the members whereas a team of 14 has 91. [Experiments](http://www.opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~kmilkman/2012_OBHDPb.pdf) have shown larger teams can be less efficient. Finally, the US Military has conducted extensive research on the topic and has found the [ideal team size](https://www.amazon.com/Team-Teams-Rules-Engagement-Complex/dp/1591847486) to be five members. Two recommendations can be drawn from this:

1. [Amazon](https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611), [Spotify](http://www.full-stackagile.com/2016/02/14/team-organisation-squads-chapters-tribes-and-guilds/) and others have demonstrated the power of small teams (<10 people) connected by api's.
2. Meetings should be as small as possible and invite those deemed absolutely necessary. Jeff Bezos ([allegedly](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/16/how-jeff-bezos-two-pizza-rule-can-lead-to-more-productive-meetings.html)) will not even show up if the meeting has more than 10 people. For the rest of us, an [8-18-1800](https://hbr.org/2015/03/how-to-know-if-there-are-too-many-people-in-your-meeting) rule can be a good guideline.

## How to stay on top of technical developments?

1. Stay up to date with data driven research on industry trends. Resources such as the [annual state of devops report](https://cloudplatformonline.com/2018-state-of-devops.html), [python developer report](https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2018/), and [stack overflow trends](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends?tags=python%2Cjavascript%2Cjava%2Cc%23%2Cphp%2Cc%2B%2B&utm_source=so-owned&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=gen-blog&utm_content=blog-link&utm_term=incredible-growth-python) are just a few of the excellent resources available.

2. Contribute to open source, which keeps one sharp as open source contributors will often hold you work to a high standard which isn't always the case within an organization for various reasons. 

3. Push yourself to achieve externally validated industry benkmarks. For example, the deployment frequency and service uptime benchmarked in the [annual devops report](https://puppet.com/resources/whitepaper/state-of-devops-report) is a good target that is generally well accepted.

## How to evaluate performance?

Software Engineer performance is difficult to measure objectively.

### Teams

Data from the [annual devops report](https://cloudplatformonline.com/2018-state-of-devops.html) which has surveyed over 30,000 developers over the past five years has found the best measures a combination of productivity and quality. Specifically 'Deployment frequency' and 'Lead time for changes' as a measure of productivity and 'Time to restore service' and 'Change failure rate' as measures of quality. They have found these measures sufficient to segment performance between Elite, High, Medium and Low performers. 

This can be a useful data point when measuring team performance. Some teams may be really productive but have poor quality. Other teams may excell at both and others still may do poorly at both. 

### Individuals

Individual engineers can be evaluated on both productivity and quality as well. 

* Productivity is easier to measure than quality and I would argue less important. An agile course or a scrum board can help you estimate tasks and track their execution over time thus reasonably measuring productivity. Non technical managers can do a good job in this area with agile experience. 

* Quality is more difficult, there are some things to look for as data points to contribute. 

1. Unit tests - Automated testing is a key indicator of quality. If an engineer fixes a bug and doesn't also create a test to ensure the bug stays fixed, then how does one know the engineer didn't cause two other bugs when they fixed the first bug? Without tests, the engineer could theorectically work forever causing bugs every time they fix a bug and then refixing the same bugs. Tests would let the engineer know when previously working code has been broken due to new changes. 

2. Comments - Documentation that shares how a code works

3. Elegance/brevity - This is more subjective, but typically less code to accomplish a task is better than more. Simpler is better than complex. If a solution is simple and short it is typically better than a solution that is big and complex. Complexity of course can not be avoided but it should be fought for every inch of ground given up. 

There is a common trap for a non-technical manager is to overly reward engineers who are productive at the expense of quality. This results in some common anti-patterns such as 'rockstar' engineers who create untested, difficult to maintain spaghetti code but are increasingly rewarded by an organization. Other 'average' engineers are often tasked with maintaining the service afterwards and can be blammed for delays in this code as they finish implementing the shortcuts of the 'rockstar'.

## Technical Debt

Technical debt is a killer of productivity and often difficult to describe to key decision makers. It eludes simple
bar charts and other measurements but clearly impacts productivity. 

Technical investment work can be framed as improvements, fixes and Upgrade/Updates to Security, Performance and Stability. When possible, develop a strategy for iterating and measuring your way to improvement.

## Sharing Progress with 3rd Parties

Kanban Trello boards are an excellent pattern to share engineering progress with third parties. These third parties can include actual clients who want to know status of features or other members within the organization such as executives. 

Notable examples:
* [Red Hat Openshift team](https://trello.com/atomicopenshift)
* [Trello sample dev board](https://trello.com/b/1Jz6SorC/the-dev-board)
* [Trello dev roadmap](https://trello.com/b/nC8QJJoZ/trello-development-roadmap)

## Documentation

Documentation in wiki's tends to become old and out of date quickly. The best documentation lives in github as markdown
next to the source code. This documentation already has an excellent CMS (git) to manage it as well as encourages updates
due to its always being present. Documentation and training are an incredible enabler of high performance teams and
getting a culture to change to one that continually updates documentation (and automation) is one of those factors that
separate great development teams from merely good development teams.
